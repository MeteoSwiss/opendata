## 1. Publication of meteorological and climatological data
The Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss publishes the data it obtains or generates to fulfil its statutory tasks ([Art. 10 Abs. 1 EMBAG](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2023/682/de#art_10)).

The data are published free of charge, promptly, in machine-readable form and in an open format on the Internet as ‘open data’ ([Art. 10 Abs. 4 EMBAG](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2023/682/de#art_10)).

MeteoSwiss uses the [Federal Spatial Data Infrastructure (FSDI)](https://www.geo.admin.ch/en/impressum-responsibilities-and-contacts), which is operated by the Federal Office of Topography swisstopo, for publication. See chapter [4. Use of the infrastructure](#4-use-of-the-infrastructure).  



## 2. Rights of use with regard to the data
The ‘Open Data’ of MeteoSwiss may be reused without restriction ([Art. 10 Abs. 4 EMBAG](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2023/682/de#art_10)).

Briefly summarised, you may:
1. **Share** - copy and redistribute the data in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.
2. **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the data for any purpose, even commercially.

The reproduction and redistribution of warnings is only permitted if they are made promptly and their content is not altered.

When reproducing or redistributing the data, **the source must be indicated** (Quelle: MeteoSchweiz; Source: MétéoSuisse; Fonte: MeteoSvizzera; **Source: MeteoSwiss**) ([Art. 5 Abs. 1 lit. a MetV](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2024/452/de#art_5)). 

When citing the source, you must ensure that you do not give the impression that MeteoSchweiz supports you or your use in particular.

## 3. Disclaimer of warranty and liability

MeteoSwiss accepts no liability for the correctness, accuracy, timeliness, reliability or completeness of the published ‘open data’ (see [Art. 10 Abs. 6 EMBAG](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2023/682/de#art_10)). Any warranty and liability on the part of MeteoSwiss is excluded to the extent permitted by law.

MeteoSwiss provides essential services within the scope of its statutory duties (in particular in the area of population and emergency protection), both for the benefit of the population (warnings) and for the attention of other authorities. We would like to point out that ensuring these services in exceptional situations may result in the updating of ‘open data’ being temporarily restricted.



## 4. Use of the infrastructure
We draw your attention to the fact that the infrastructure used by MeteoSwiss for ‘Open Data’ may only be used to the extent necessary to obtain the data. Improper use (in particular use with the aim of damaging the infrastructure or blocking its availability) and excessive use in terms of access frequency or data volume (in particular high-frequency downloading of the same content) is prohibited and may result in your access being restricted or blocked ([Art. 5 Abs. 1 lit. d and Abs. 2 MetV](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2024/452/de#art_5)).

The [General Terms of Use and Operating Conditions of the Federal Spatial Data Infrastructure FSDI](https://www.geo.admin.ch/en/general-terms-of-use-fsdi) also apply. Particular attention should be paid to chapter [2. Data use](https://www.geo.admin.ch/en/general-terms-of-use-fsdi#2.-Data-use) and chapter [5 General operating conditions](https://www.geo.admin.ch/en/general-terms-of-use-fsdi#5-General-operating-conditions).
