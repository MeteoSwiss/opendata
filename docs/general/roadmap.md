# Roadmap (in preparation)
This is the **current roadmap of our Open Data service**, which will guide us through the year 2026.
- It is iterated on at least a quarterly basis.
- It allows us to plan for change. It captures intent, not solutions. The further into the future a thing will take place, the more uncertain it is. 
- Things can be added to or dropped from the roadmap. In the latter case, we document this below under ‘Items removed from the roadmap’, including the date and reason. 

Our roadmap is based on the **long-term vision of our Open Data service** (*URL forthcoming*).

**Our strategy is delivery**.
