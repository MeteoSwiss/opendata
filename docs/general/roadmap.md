# Roadmap (in preparation)
This is the current **roadmap** (*in preparation*) of our Open Data service, which will guide us until the end of 2026.
- It is iterated on at least a quarterly basis.
- It allows us to plan for change. It captures intent, not solutions. The further into the future a mission will take place, the more uncertain it is. 
- Things can be added to or dropped from the roadmap. In the latter case, we document this below under ‘Items removed from the roadmap’, including the date and reason. 

Our roadmap is based on the long-term **vision** of our service (*URL forthcoming*). Our **strategy** is delivery.

## Q1: January until March 2026
