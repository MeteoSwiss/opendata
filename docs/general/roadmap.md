# Roadmap
This is the **current roadmap of our Open Data service**, which will guide us through the year 2026.
- It is iterated on at least a quarterly basis.
- It allows us to plan for change. It captures intent, not solutions. The further into the future a thing will take place, the more uncertain it is. 
- Things can be added to or dropped from the roadmap. In the latter case, we document this below under ‘Items removed from the roadmap’, including the date and reason. 

:::tip

The roadmap is based on the [**Vision and strategy** of MeteoSwiss' Open Data provision](./background-objectives#vision-mission-and-strategy-of-meteoswiss-open-data-provision). In a nutshell:
- MeteoSwiss is implementing Open Data access in two stages, first through bulk download, then through APIs.
- Where implemented, both access modes remain operational.
