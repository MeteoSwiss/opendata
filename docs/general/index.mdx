# General information

Welcome to MeteoSwiss' Open Data documentation.

Starting 22 May 2025, [MeteoSwiss](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/about-us/legal-mandate.html) is gradually making its data accessible as [Open Government Data](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/services/ogd/at-a-glance.html) (OGD). The available data can either be downloaded manually or obtained automatically as files.

We start with 
- [**A - Ground-based measurements**](/a-data-groundbased)
- [**C - Climate data:** Homogeneous data series](/c-climate-data)
- [**E - Forecast data:** Numerical weather forecasting model ICON-CH1/2-EPS](/e-forecast-data)

Additional datasets will be released in the following months. The expected quarter for each dataset will be announced on our [Open Data landing page](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/service/open-data.html).

MeteoSwiss is also working to enable access to certain data through individual API queries. However, this option will not be available before 2026.
