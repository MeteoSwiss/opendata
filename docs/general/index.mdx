# General Information

## Terms of Use
[Here](/general/terms-of-use) you'll find information about data license and conditions for usage.

## Getting Started with Download
[Here](/general/download) you'll find information about how to download files either manually or programmatically, and learn about how data files are structured (data granularities and update cycles) and date/time, time intervals and missing values are represented.

## Staying up to Date
For operational status, **see** [Download API Status & Contact](general/status) *[upcoming]*

geo.admin.ch's download service will not be subject to big breaking changes, because it adheres to the OGC STAC API standard. Our partner [swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en) continuously develops and improves it, so minor changes and bug fixes might change the behavior of the API. If you suspect your integration has broken due to changed behavior, **check** [Release Notes](https://api3.geo.admin.ch/releasenotes/index.html) where swisstopo announces released changes that might affect your integration.

In the event of malfunctions at ground-based stations, **check** for [interruptions in data availability](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/applications/data-availability.html).

We keep interested parties and users up to date on our plans and changes: **register** for [our newsletter](#upcoming) *[upcoming]*
