# General Information

Welcome to MeteoSwiss' Open Data documentation.

Starting in May 2025, MeteoSwiss is gradually making its data accessible as Open Government Data (OGD). The available data can either be downloaded manually or obtained automatically as files.

<!-- We start with [ground-based measurements](/a-data-groundbased), [homogeneous measurements](/c-climate-data/c1-climate-stations_homogeneous) and [numerical weather forecasting model data](/e-forecast-data/e2-e3-numerical-weather-forecasting-model). Additional datasets will be released in the following months. The expected quarter for each dataset is announced on our [Open Data landing page](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/services/open-data.html). -->

We are also working to enable access to certain data through individual API queries. However, this option will not be available before 2026.

## Public Beta - April 2025

We are currently setting up our service as Beta.

⚠️ During this phase everything is subject to change without prior notice.

Everyone can access the available Open Data already via [FSDI's STAC API](/general/download). The access URLs are provided in the documentation for the corresponding data:
- [Ground-based measurements](/a-data-groundbased)
- [Homogeneous measurements](/c-climate-data/c1-climate-stations_homogeneous)
- [Numerical weather forecasting model](/e-forecast-data/e2-e3-numerical-weather-forecasting-model)

⚠️ We welcome your feedback. We collect all of it and answer it collectively to all users via our [Open Data repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/opendata/discussions/categories/public-beta-april-2025), rather than individually.

## Terms of Use
[Here](/general/terms-of-use) you'll find information about data license and conditions for usage.

## Getting Started with Download
[Here](/general/download) you'll find information about how to download files either manually or programmatically, and learn about how data files are structured (data granularities and update cycles) and date/time, time intervals and missing values are represented.

## Staying up to Date
For operational status, **see** [Download API Status & Contact](/general/status) *[upcoming]*

geo.admin.ch's download service will not be subject to big breaking changes, because it adheres to the OGC STAC API standard. Our partner [swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en) continuously develops and improves it, so minor changes and bug fixes might change the behavior of the API. If you suspect your integration has broken due to changed behavior, **check** [Release Notes](https://api3.geo.admin.ch/releasenotes/index.html) where swisstopo announces released changes that might affect your integration.

In the event of malfunctions at ground-based stations, **check** for [interruptions in data availability](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/applications/data-availability.html).

We keep interested parties and users up to date on our plans and changes: **register** for [our newsletter](#) *[upcoming]*
