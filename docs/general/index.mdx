# General information

Welcome to MeteoSwiss' Open Data documentation.

[MeteoSwiss](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/about-us/legal-mandate.html) is gradually making its data accessible as [Open Government Data](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/services/ogd/at-a-glance.html) (OGD). 

The available data can either be downloaded manually or obtained automatically as files:
- [**A - Ground-based measurements**](/a-data-groundbased)
- [**B - Atmosphere measurements**](/b-data-atmosphere)
- [**C - Climate data**](/c-climate-data)
- [**D - Radar data**](/d-radar-data)
- [**E - Forecast data**](/e-forecast-data)

Additional data will be released in the following months. As soon as a release can be planned, the expected quarter will be announced on the overview pages (A to E) above. 

MeteoSwiss is also working to enable access to certain data through individual API queries. However, this option will not be available before 2026.

Please check the [current roadmap of our Open Data service](/general/roadmap) to see what we are working on and when.
