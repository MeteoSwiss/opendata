# General information

Welcome to MeteoSwiss' Open Data documentation.

Starting in May 2025, [MeteoSwiss](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/about-us/legal-mandate.html) is gradually making its data accessible as [Open Government Data](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/services/ogd/at-a-glance.html) (OGD). The available data can either be downloaded manually or obtained automatically as files.

<!-- We start with [ground-based measurements](/a-data-groundbased), [homogeneous measurements](/c-climate-data/c1-climate-stations_homogeneous) and [numerical weather forecasting model data](/e-forecast-data/e2-e3-numerical-weather-forecasting-model). Additional datasets will be released in the following months. The expected quarter for each dataset is announced on our [Open Data landing page](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/services/open-data.html). -->

MeteoSwiss is also working to enable access to certain data through individual API queries. However, this option will not be available before 2026.

## Public Beta - April/May 2025

We are currently setting up our service as Beta.

:::warning

During this phase everything is subject to change without prior notice.

:::

Everyone can access the available Open Data already via [geo.admin.ch's STAC API](/general/download). The access URLs are provided in the documentation for the corresponding datasets/collections:
- [Ground-based measurements](/a-data-groundbased)
- [Homogeneous measurements](/c-climate-data)
- [Numerical weather forecasting model](/e-forecast-data)

:::tip

We welcome [your feedback](/general/contact). During our Public Beta phase we may answer it collectively to all users via our [Open Data repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/opendata/discussions/categories/public-beta-april-2025), rather than individually.
