# Local forecast data

Meteoswiss produces point forecasts for about 6000 locations displayed in our [App](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/service/weather-and-climate-products/meteoswiss-app.html) and [website](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/local-forecasts/geneva/1201.html#forecast-tab=detail-view). These forecasts are produced by optimally combining the best sources of information available to generate seamless forecasts for 9 full days (including the current day). More details can be found in [generation-of-high-quality-localised-forecasts](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/warning-and-forecasting-systems/generation-of-high-quality-localised-forecasts.html).

New forecasts for temperature, precipitation, wind, clouds, sunshine, radiation and [weather symbols](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/weather-and-climate-from-a-to-z/weather-symbols.html) are available every hour. Note that on our App these forecasts are updated more frequently.
