# Local forecast data

MeteoSwiss produces point forecasts for about 6000 locations, which are displayed on our [MeteoSwiss App](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/service/weather-and-climate-products/meteoswiss-app.html) and [website](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/local-forecasts/geneva/1201.html#forecast-tab=detail-view). These forecasts are produced by optimally combining the best sources of information available to generate seamless forecasts for nine full days (including the current day). Further information can be found in [Generation of high-quality localised forecasts](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/warning-and-forecasting-systems/generation-of-high-quality-localised-forecasts.html).

New forecasts for temperature, precipitation, wind, clouds, sunshine, radiation and [weather symbols*](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/weather-and-climate-from-a-to-z/weather-symbols.html) are available every hour. Please note that these forecasts are updated more frequently on our app.

*You are not permitted to reuse the weather symbols from MeteoSwiss. The data that can be reused includes the codes for the weather symbols, so you can label them with symbols that you are allowed to use.
