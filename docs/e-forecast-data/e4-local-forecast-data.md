# Local forecast data

MeteoSwiss produces point forecasts for about 6000 locations, which are displayed on our [MeteoSwiss App](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/service/weather-and-climate-products/meteoswiss-app.html) and [website](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/local-forecasts/geneva/1201.html#forecast-tab=detail-view). These forecasts are produced by optimally combining the best sources of information available to generate seamless forecasts for nine full days (including the current day). Further information can be found in [Generation of high-quality localised forecasts](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/warning-and-forecasting-systems/generation-of-high-quality-localised-forecasts.html).

New forecasts for temperature, precipitation, wind, clouds, sunshine, radiation and [weather symbols*](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/weather-and-climate-from-a-to-z/weather-symbols.html) are available every hour. Please note that these forecasts are updated more frequently on our app.
