# MeteoSwiss - Open Data
MeteoSwiss' continuously updated Open Data documentation is published at [opendatadocs.meteoswiss.ch](https://opendatadocs.meteoswiss.ch). 

⚠️ We are currently [**setting up our service as BETA**](https://opendatadocs.meteoswiss.ch/#public-beta---april-2025). Everything is subject to change without prior notice.

<!-- For now MeteoSwiss provides its Open Data to be consumed by **[downloading the data as files](https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/opendata/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started-with-download)**. -->

<!--
Starting in May 2025, MeteoSwiss is gradually making its data freely accessible to the public as Open Government Data (OGD). The availablee data can either be [downloaded manually or obtained programmatically as files](#getting-started-with-download).

- **Priority** columns in the tables below show the planned order in which the datasets/collections become available.
- **Planning** can be adjusted on an ongoing basis.

In order to also offer the option of accessing the data at a later stage using [individual queries via APIs](https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/opendata-api/blob/main/README.md), the necessary preparatory work is underway. As soon as introduction dates for this second type of access can be estimated, they will be communicated here.

## General Information

### Terms of Use
[Here](https://meteoswiss.github.io/opendata-terms-of-use/) you'll find information about data license and conditions for usage.

### Getting Started with Download
[Here](https://meteoswiss.github.io/opendata-download/) you'll find information about how to download files either manually or programmatically, learn about how data files are structured (data granularities and update cycles), and how `date/time`, `time intervals` and `missing values` are represented.

### Staying up to Date
For operational status, **see** [Download API Status & Contact](https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/opendata-status/blob/main/README.md) *[upcoming]*

geo.admin.ch's download service will not be subject to big breaking changes, because it adheres to the OGC STAC API standard. Our partner [swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en) continuously develops and improves it, so minor changes and bug fixes might change the behavior of the API. If you suspect your integration has broken due to changed behavior, **check** [Release Notes](https://api3.geo.admin.ch/releasenotes/index.html) where swisstopo announces released changes that might affect your integration.

In the event of malfunctions at ground-based stations, **check** for [interruptions in data availability](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/applications/data-availability.html).

We keep interested parties and users up to date on our plans and changes: **register** for [our newsletter](...) *[upcoming]*

### Frequently Asked Questions
[Here](https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/opendata-faq/blob/main/README.md) *[upcoming]* you'll **find answers** to the most frequently asked questions. 

We continuously update these based on questions received. If you cannot find an answer to your question, **contact us**.

### Contact
If you have [questions about the data](#a---ground-based-measurements), or [how to use the download service](https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/opendata-download/blob/main/README.md), please read the [Frequently Asked Questions](...) *[upcoming]*.

## Understanding MeteoSwiss' Open Data
The documentations of the Open Data products linked below explain what the data represents, its models, abstractions and terminology.

ℹ️ **Priority** columns below show the planned order (from 1️⃣ to 4️⃣) in which the datasets/‘Collections‘ become available. **Planning** can be adjusted on an ongoing basis.

ℹ️ **File metadata:** All point measurement datasets/‘Collections‘ have three ‘file metadata’ files: `meta_stations.csv`, `meta_parameters.csv` and `datainventory.csv`. <br>
They are provided as ‘Assets’ to the corresponding dataset/‘Collection‘ (not at the level of each individual ‘Item‘/station.
